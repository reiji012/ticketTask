Modal controller as in mail or Apple music application. Similar animation and transition. I tried to repeat all the animations, corner radius and frames. The controller supports gestures and Navigation Bar & work with ScrollView.

The project is absolutely free, but but it takes time to support and update it. Your support is very motivating and very important. I often receive emails asking me to update or add functionality. [Small donate](https://money.yandex.ru/to/410012745748312) for a cup of coffee helps to develop the project and make it better

## Requirements
Swift 4.2. Ready for use on iOS 10+

## Integration
Drop in `Source/SPStorkController` folder to your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

Or via CocoaPods:
```ruby
pod 'SPStorkController'
```

and import library in class:
```swift
import SPStorkController
```

## How to use
Create controller and set `transitioningDelegate` to `SPStorkTransitioningDelegate` object. Use `present` or `dismiss` functions:

```swift
import UIKit
import SPStorkController

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)

        let controller = UIViewController()
        let transitionDelegate = SPStorkTransitioningDelegate()
        controller.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate
        controller.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
        self.present(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
```

Please, _not_ init `SPStorkTransitioningDelegate` like here:

```swift
controller.transitioningDelegate = SPStorkTransitioningDelegate()
```

You get error about weak property.

### Parametrs

- Parametr `isSwipeToDismissEnabled` enable dissmiss by swipe gester. Defualt is `true`:

```swift
transitionDelegate.isSwipeToDismissEnabled = true
```

- Parametr `showIndicator` show or hide top arrow indicator. Defualt is `true`:
```swift
transitionDelegate.showIndicator = true
```

- Parametr `customHeight` set custom height for modal controller. Defualt is `nil`:
```swift
transitionDelegate.customHeight = 350
```

### Add Navigation Bar
You may want to add a navigation bar to your modal controller. Since it became impossible to change or customize the native controller in swift 4 (I couldn’t even find a way to change the height of bar), I completely create navigation bar. Visually, it looks real, but it doesn’t execute the necessary functions:

```swift
import UIKit

class ModalController: UIViewController {
    
    let navBar = SPFakeBarView(style: .stork)
        
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white

        self.navBar.titleLabel.text = "Title"
        self.navBar.leftButton.setTitle("Cancel", for: .normal)
        self.navBar.leftButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(self.dismissAction), for: .touchUpInside)

        self.view.addSubview(self.navBar)
    }
}
```

You only need to add a navigation bar to the main view, it will automatically layout. Use style `.stork` in init `SPFakeBarView`. It is image preview with Navigation Bar and without it:

For use `SPFakeBarView` you should install [SparrowKit](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SparrowKit) pod: 

```ruby
pod 'SparrowKit'
```

### Work with UIScrollView

If you use `UIScrollView` (or UITableView & UICollectionView) on your controller, I recommend making it more interactive. When the scroll reaches the top position, the controller will interactively drag down, simulating a closing animation. To do this, set the delegate and in the function `scrollViewDidScroll` call:

```swift
func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
    SPStorkController.scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView)
}
```

## My projects

Here I would like to offer you my other projects

### SPPermission
Project [SPPermission](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission) for managing permissions with the customizable visual effects. Beautiful dialog increases the chance of approval (which is important when we request notification). Simple control of this module saves you hours of development. You can start using project with just two lines of code and easy customization!

### SparrowKit
The `SPStorkController` in the past was part of [SparrowKit](https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SparrowKit) library. In library you can find many useful extensions & classes. For install via CocoaPods use:

```ruby
pod 'SparrowKit'
```
